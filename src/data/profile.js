        about: "I'm a Data Science Masters Graduate who loves coding and is interested to learn web-development to increase my employability. I've always found React to be daunting, not being very experienced in JS, but I decided to take up the challenge anyways! With that, I've been surprised how well I've caught up and Scrimba has been an amazing platform for me to learn :D",
        interests: "Other than coding and programming, I enjoy dancing! My main styles of interest are popping and hip hop. I also perform and cover Kpop choreographies with my friends in the Melbourne community!"
